# Overview

To imrpove my skills as a software engineer I have created a simple python and ggogle firbase program for event planning to learn how to work with Google Firbase using the Pyrebase4 Library.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}
My program is a simple event planner, use for storing and retreiving information on events such as parties, weddings, funerals, conventions, business meetings, etc. Users can create, modify, delete, and read data from a central databse in real time allowing them to track progress on an event, see the key details, and what needs to be done. The results are printed to the console or terminal.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
To learn how to use

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

I am using google Firebaseits real time databse feature to create and manage a databse.





{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}



# Development Environment

I used vsCode as my text editor.
For the program I used the Python programming language and the the Pyrebase4 Library to access the database.
